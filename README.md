## Overview

Explore the world of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging with the Viterbi Algorithm in this repository, which showcases Iman Kianian's work for Homework 3 in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The central focus of this project is implementing POS tagging on a given dataset using the powerful Viterbi Algorithm.

## Repository Structure

- **Iman Kianian _ NLP _ HW3.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of POS tagging with the Viterbi Algorithm.
- **README.md**: Initial commit information and repository overview.
- **Report.pdf**: PDF document summarizing the methodology, experiments, and results of POS tagging using Viterbi.
- **Test.txt**: Test dataset used for evaluating the POS tagging model.
- **Train.txt**: Training dataset employed for developing the Viterbi-based POS tagging model.

## Usage

- Dive into the Jupyter notebook, "Iman Kianian _ NLP _ HW3.ipynb," for a detailed exploration of POS tagging using the Viterbi Algorithm.
- Reference the accompanying PDF report, "Report.pdf," for a comprehensive overview of the methodology and findings.
- Leverage the provided "Test.txt" and "Train.txt" datasets for hands-on experimentation with POS tagging.
